# Stock Data Visualization App
#### This project is a full-stack web application built with ReactJS (frontend) and Django REST Framework (backend). The application loads stock market data from a JSON file, stores it in an SQL database, and visualizes it in a table with editable rows. Additionally, it includes a multi-axis chart for better insights.

### Features
* ✅ REST API built with Django REST Framework (DRF)
* ✅ CRUD operations for stock data
* ✅ Frontend built with ReactJS
* ✅ Interactive table with editable rows
* ✅ Line & bar chart for data visualization
* ✅ Dropdown filter for selecting trade codes
* ✅ Fast data loading optimization
* ✅ Deployment-ready

### Tech Stack
* Backend (Python + Django REST Framework)
* Django
* Django REST Framework
* PostgreSQL / SQLite (depending on setup)
* Virtual environment (venv)
* Frontend (ReactJS)
* React.js
* Tailwind CSS (for styling)
* Recharts (for charts)
* Axios (for API calls)


### Challenges Faced & Learnings
#### Challenges
* Handling large datasets in React while keeping the UI smooth
* Optimizing API calls to prevent slow loading
* Ensuring proper database indexing for fast queries
* Integrating multi-axis charts for better visualization
#### What I Learned
* Using Django REST Framework for scalable APIs
* Improving React performance with optimized rendering
